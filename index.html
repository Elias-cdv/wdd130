            <p>Hi everyone! I'm Elias Cabeza de Vaca, I'm from Guayaquil Ecuador, and I have 21 years old. 
               I'm Karate student, I love music, fantasy books, and I'm Pathway student. I serve in Colombia 
               Bogota South Mission, and I really enjoy the mission. I am an energetic person, I really enjoy 
               outdoor activities and taking pictures when I am out and about.

            <p> The photo is not the most popular photo about Ecuador. I'm not including the wonderful mountains, 
                or the coast, or the amazonic jungle, nor the galapagos Islands. My city, Guayaquil, is the most 
                populated in the country. Crossed by rivers, the city of Guayaquil is an important port for the 
                country's economy. The Guayas River has a particularity: its flow is mixed, so it goes on both sides. 
                Its climate is humid and hot, so the famous "coconut water" is welcomed by all citizens to hydrate. 
                In this photo, we see how the Chimborazo volcano, despite being more than 100 km from the city, 
                a certain times of the year, when the sun and the clouds are favorable, the city can appreciate 
                the beauty of the imposing volcano.
